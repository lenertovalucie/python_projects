My python projects

Here is some information about the scripts I have written. I create these little programs as experiments to have a play with the language, or to solve a problem for myself.

- /bulls_and_cows/bullsandcows.py - text game, the goal of the game is to uncover the 4-digit secret number
- /hackathon/cv_parser.py - script to parse PDF resumes, create a csv file containing info
- /project_euler/ - Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. This folder include solutions of project euler problems.
